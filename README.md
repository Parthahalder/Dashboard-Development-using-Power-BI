DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK PERFORMED ---
The hotel booking dashboard project was developed using Power BI to generate meaningful insights from booking data collected across various countries. The dataset included parameters like lead time, cancellation status, number of nights stayed, booking channels, customer segments, revenue, loss, profit, and country of origin. The project aimed to uncover trends and patterns in guest behavior, revenue generation, and booking efficiency.

Key visualizations included total revenue tracking, weekday-wise revenue analysis, and customer segmentation based on booking characteristics. A special focus was placed on analyzing lead time, where a custom measure was created to compare average daily rates for bookings made more than 30 days in advance versus those within a 30-day window. Maps were used to show country-wise booking and revenue distribution, while slicers and filters allowed dynamic interaction with different data views.

The dashboard effectively highlighted critical metrics such as cancellation rates, profit-loss margins, and occupancy trends, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions. This project demonstrated the power of BI tools in transforming raw data into actionable insights for the hospitality sector.
